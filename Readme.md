# This is my weather app. It takes a zip code and gives you the weather information for that area.

This tool is written in Java using the MVC methodology. 

Api keys from previous commits have been deactivated of course. 

In order to get this working for yourself you will have to register for an API key at openweathermap.org

Here is a gif of this app in action!
